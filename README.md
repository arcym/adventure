A dungeon crawling top-down action adventure game inspired by the Legend of Zelda from the NES. It features five procedurally generated dungeons with randomly distributed treasure and enemies. Fight monsters, manage your resources, and escape from the nothingness!

The game was developed by a team of six students in the course of eight weeks.  After it was finished, it was be deployed on the Mocs Arcade Cabinet, and submitted to the Indie Game Festival Student Competition. Learn more about the development of the project at our [Trello] or [Tumblr].
