We recommend you use Eclipse. Feel free to use your own IDE, but you are on your own!

1) Make a github account.

2) Fork our repository: https://github.com/computc/adventure. This can be accomplished by logging into github, clicking that link, and clicking 'Fork' in the upper-right hand corner.

3) On your fork (should say 'username/adventure' in the upper-left corner), click 'download zip'. 

4) Unzip this file into whatever your working directory is.

5) Download Eclipse, if you do not already have it.

6) Install EGit. This can be done by opening up Eclipse and clicking 'Help--Eclipse Marketplace...'. This should open a window with lots of eclipse add-ons. Search for Egit and install.

5) Click Right-click in the package explorer (the left side of the screen), choose 'import', expand 'git', then click 'Projects from Git'.

6) Click 'Existing local repository'

7) Click 'Add...'

8) Click 'Browse...' and point it towards the repository (the folder you just unzipped). Click 'Finish' after you have selected it.

9) Commits, Pulls, and Pushes can now be done by right-clicking the project in the Package Explorer and hovering over 'Team'.

Recommended:
Download SourceTree for Git management. This allows you to clone, commit, push, pull, view diffs, stage, and everything else, in an easy-to-understand way. If you would like help configuring it, email fpruitt0922@gmail.com for more info.
